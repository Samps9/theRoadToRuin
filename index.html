					<p class="no-widget-post-content"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/theroadtoruin/church-on-fire" target="_blank">"Church On Fire"</a> was based on an old song Miles  wrote years ago in high school. While almost the same chord progression as the older song, "Church on Fire" sports mostly new lyrics and a new verse melody. Katie Ortiz gave it a kick ass rock n' roll vocal and Dave Kahn played some ripping leads.</p>

					<p class="no-widget-post-content">Miles wrote <a href="https://soundcloud.com/theroadtoruin/the-freaks-arent-freaks-anymore" target="_blank">"The Freaks Aren't Freaks Anymore"</a> song last year, shortly after David Bowie's passing. He wanted to write about Bowie's way of bringing people together by turning the absurd and vulgar into the pop of the hour. He drew so many out into space and so many thrived there because of him. This is probably Miles' favorite song on the record. We hope you enjoy!! </p>

Rob played the drums piece by piece, which was a method we'd never tried but we like the way it came out. Anyway, enjoy!!!

Instead of starting with a melody and lyric and building a recording around it, Residue started with a beat, then the riffs, and from there built the vocal tune and wrote the lyric. </p>

Miles recorded all the layered keyboard lines on a Yamaha CP-35 he had recently acquired. We were actually just testing it out but we liked what we came up with so it grew into a full recording. The song itself Miles had written about a month before and had planned to make it an acoustic sort of thing, the final recording turned out to be very different from the initial vision. The lyrics are very personal to Miles and discuss a line of thinking he often finds himself following.</p>

Sung by Katie Ortiz, this recording was very collaborative. Sam Lubin's bass line set up the rhythm track and we all came up with an instrumental part to highlight it. The result was all grooves and negative space, enjoy!!!</p>
